# Simple example

This is a simple example for people without a lot of experience in Python and matplotlib.

Here we asked chatGPT to help us create a bar chart, and then I debugged it with some error messages.

Then once the first example worked I started talking to the chatGpt to learn more about how to do everything and what each line meant. I graduated to a more complciated example.
